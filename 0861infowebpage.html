		<p>These Marines observe and adjust artillery and naval surface fire support, which includes using laser designators and rangefinders, employing radar beacons for support ships and coordinating lethal and non-lethal fire support assets such as mortars, rockets, and cannons.
        <br> These Marines also operate sophisticated communications equipment, as they're tasked with establishing radio networks for voice and other communications, including during combat operations. And they also operate Marine Corps fire support systems.
        <br>The training for this position is rigorous and demanding; roughly 25 percent of those who enter the training program fails to advance and are recycled into other Marine jobs.</p>
